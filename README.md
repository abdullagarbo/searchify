## Getting Started

Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

For testing

```bash
npm run test
```

OBS!!!

If I had more time, I would implement Redux state management, because it helps to manage "global" state - state that is needed across many parts of the application
